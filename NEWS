Changes since 0.2:

Most methods in Database now throw runtime exceptions instead
of checked exceptions.  If you are of the checked exception
persuasion, or you have some piece of code which expects 
an SQLException, just call MayflyException#asSqlException. 

Many forms of ALTER TABLE now work.

Some limited query optimization.  It is now possible to,
for example, implicitly join 3 tables of 1000 rows each, 
in some cases.  The query optimizer is still dead simple -
it proceeds from left to right and can decompose a WHERE
clause made up of AND.  For example, 
"SELECT * from foo, bar, baz where foo.x = bar.x"
will get optimized to
inner join on foo and bar on foo.x = bar.x
inner join that with baz
whereas
"SELECT * from foo, bar, baz where bar.x = baz.x"
will perform all the joins (requiring temporary storage
of the number of rows in foo times the number of rows
in bar times the number of rows in baz), and only
then apply the WHERE.

Changes from 0.1 to 0.2:

Adds schemas (and SET SCHEMA), GROUP BY, auto-increment columns, 
and primary and foreign keys.
