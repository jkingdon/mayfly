<p>Although there are a vast number of free and non-free SQL
implementations, few of them are really good for unit testing.  A
database for unit testing should be very fast on small data sets and
should not present performance or other obstacles to setting up
databases, adding and removing tables, and destroying databases.  A
typical unit test run will want to create thousands of databases.
With most SQL databases, this is not achievable, and one must resort
to compromises such as keeping the tables around and only setting up
data on each unit test run.  Mayfly aims to make creating an in-memory
SQL database as easy as creating any other in-memory data structure.</p>

<p>As of 20 Oct 2005, Mayfly allows any number of tables, columns, and rows, but queries only support one table at a time, only <tt>int</tt> is supported as a data type, and
any but the simplest SQL does not yet work.  <a href="http://sf.net/projects/mayfly/cvs" >Check back</a>, though, because we are actively developing Mayfly.</p>
