<p>Here are the notes I (Jim Kingdon) prepared for the Mayfly session at <a href="http://sdtconf.com" 
>Simple Design &amp; Testing</a> in 2007.  Because this is a very informal conference,
these notes are only an approximate match to what we really talked about.</p>

<ol>

<li>
What is mayfly?

<ul>
<li>
In-memory database written in Java (have tried it with java,
    would like to play with groovy, jruby, jython, etc)
</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>
What SQL syntax does it support?

<ul>
<li>
Borrow syntax/semantics from other databases (the most widely supported
    one(s), usually, or the best).  Especially where there is
    no common syntax which works on other databases, support more
    than one.
    </li>
    
<li>Aim to be compatible with production database (most well-developed 
    with MySQL currently but open to contributions)
    </li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>    
Why Yet Another SQL Implementation?

<ul>
<li>
Generally faster than postgres, mysql, etc (at least, on the mayfly tests)
</li>
  
<li>Roughly as fast as hypersonic (faster on some things, slower on others,
    aim to make mayfly faster)</li>
    
<li>Good error messages (see <a href="ErrorMessageTest.java" >ErrorMessageTest</a>)</li>
<li>Dumps which you can diff (see <a href="DumperTest.java" >DumperTest</a>)</li>
<li>Snapshot/restore (see <a href="IsolationTest.java" >IsolationTest</a> for how to isolate tests with this)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Does it talk to Hibernate, etc?

<ul>
<li>
Haven't tried the "etc", but see <a href="../hibernate-demo" >hibernate-demo</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>
