Changes since 0.2:

The new SqlDumper class can dump a database.

Now can insert hex literals into BLOB columns, for example:
INSERT INTO foo(a) VALUES(x'aa65fe')

Most methods in Database now throw runtime exceptions instead
of checked exceptions.  If you are of the checked exception
persuasion, or you have some piece of code which expects 
an SQLException, just call MayflyException#asSqlException. 
JDBC methods, of course, continue to throw SQLException

Many forms of ALTER TABLE now work.

Some limited query optimization.  It is now possible to,
for example, implicitly join 3 tables of 1000 rows each, 
in some cases.  The query optimizer is still dead simple -
it proceeds from left to right and can decompose a WHERE
clause made up of AND.  For example, 
"SELECT * from foo, bar, baz where foo.x = bar.x"
will get optimized to
inner join foo and bar on foo.x = bar.x
inner join that with baz
whereas
"SELECT * from foo, bar, baz where bar.x = baz.x"
will perform all the joins, and only
then apply the WHERE (requiring temporary storage
of the number of rows in foo times the number of rows
in bar times the number of rows in baz).

Changes from 0.1 to 0.2:

Adds schemas (and SET SCHEMA), GROUP BY, auto-increment columns, 
and primary and foreign keys.
