* What to compare speed on:
  - create a bunch of tables and a few rows, then close database.
  - joins.  This is where the naive approach to queries might break down.

* Transaction isolation.  Fully isolated (probably by making the database
data structure immutable) should be doable.  How to best simulate the behavior of
whatever database you are going to use in production?  Is there a way
to be especially anal (are there cases we can detect and complain on,
with respect to applications assuming too much/too little isolation)?

Possible features (beyond those in DESCRIPTION.txt):

* Stored procedures, perhaps compatible with hypersonic stored procedures.
  This is probably the most graceful way to provide the Oracle TO_DATE
  function, for example (either as a full implementation, or just
  as a project-specific implementation which only supports a single
  date format).
