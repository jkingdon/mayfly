Mayfly is an in-memory SQL database designed for unit testing.  It is
designed to make creating and destroying databases or tables as easy 
as creating and destroying objects, and to make it easy to do things
like compare two databases.

The documentation, including installation instructions,
is in the doc directory (online at http://mayfly.sourceforge.net/doc ).

The mayfly home page is at http://mayfly.sourceforge.net/
