Instructions for people maintaining these web pages:

* Check in all changes to git.

* Push individual files to sourceforge (where we currently host the web site) using sftp as described at http://alexandria.wiki.sourceforge.net/Project+Web,+Shell,+VHOST+and+Database+Services
Quick summary is:
$ sftp SOURCEFORGE_USER,mayfly@web.sourceforge.net
Connecting to web.sourceforge.net...
sftp> cd htdocs
sftp> put index.html
Uploading index.html to /home/groups/m/ma/mayfly/htdocs/index.html
index.html                                    100% 4288     4.2KB/s   00:00    
sftp> quit
$ 

* Probably it will be easier to rsync it to sourceforge, as soon as I figure that out.
